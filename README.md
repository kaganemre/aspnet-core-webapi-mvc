WebAPI and WebUI projects were developed on Onion Architecture. The reason I chose this architecture is to minimize the dependency between application layers and provide changes at the lowest cost. We implemented Loose Coupling between application layers. Asp.Net Core MVC project performs CRUD operations via Asp.Net Core Web API project. You can get the project up and running with Docker Compose.
